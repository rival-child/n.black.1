<h1>The Renaissance Academy's school is finally finished!<h1/>
<h2>Students and Teachers Relieved<h2/>
<p>The Renaissance Academy has finally moved into its permanent building. It's been a long road for the students and the teachers. They've had to move multiple times, even a few times in one school year. <q>I'm so glad we aren't moving around anymore,<q/> states one of the students.<p/>
<p><q>It's nice to finally have a permanent room,<q/> one of the teachers proudly showed us around her room. She was so excitied to be able to really set her room up exactly how she wanted.<p/> 
<p>So, everyone's happy and excited that the new schools finished. The Renaissance Academy has a home to call it's own. Signing off, N. Black.<p/>
